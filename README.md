# SlicerOpenLIFU

Low intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) is a method of neuromodulation. This
uses ultrasound as a non-destructive treatment as opposed to using it for
imaging.

Build this extension by following [the usual procedure for Slicer
extensions](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#build-an-extension).

## 📦 Included Modules

### 🏠 OpenLIFUHome

The central interface module providing navigation controls for other modules.

### 💾 OpenLIFUDatabase

Facilitates communication with a local OpenLIFU database for persistent storage
and retrieval of user data, protocol configurations, and treatment sessions.

### 🔐 OpenLIFULogin

Manages user authentication and account access within the OpenLIFU database.
Primarily used by the standalone OpenLIFU application.

### 📊 OpenLIFUData

Coordinates subject and session data during treatment workflows. Tracks active
subjects, sessions, and computed solutions, and makes them available to all
modules.

### 🧠 OpenLIFUPrePlanning

Enables initial patient setup, including image loading, target selection, and
virtual fitting of an OpenLIFU transducer. Prepares the system for transducer
tracking and sonication planning.

### 🛰️ OpenLIFUTransducerTracker

Imports photos from the Openwater Android app to generate photogrammetric
meshes. These meshes are used to align the transducer with imaging for
neuronavigation.

### 🔬 OpenLIFUSonicationPlanner

Simulates sonication, checks safety parameters, and generates hardware
configurations based on target location and transducer setup.

### 🎯 OpenLIFUSonicationControl

Interfaces with Openwater focused ultrasound transducer hardware to execute
planned sonications. Supports real-time monitoring and device control.

### ⚙️  OpenLIFUProtocolConfig

Manages treatment protocols in the OpenLIFU database, including frequency,
intensity, and pulse duration settings used in planning and treatment.

### 📚 OpenLIFULib

A shared utility library containing core classes and functions used system-wide.
Includes transducer definitions, solution computations, coordinate
transformations, and simulation tools.

## Pairing with 3D Open Water App

### Install Android Platform Tools

**macOS:**  

```bash
brew install android-platform-tools
```

**Linux:**  

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install android-tools-adb
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**  

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
irm get.scoop.sh | iex
scoop install android-platform-tools
```

Or download from [Google's
platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools) and
add it to your `PATH`.

### Enable USB Debugging on Android

1. On your Android device, go to **Settings → About phone → Software information**.
2. Tap **Build number** 7 times until you see "You are now a developer!".
3. Go to **Settings → System → Developer options**.
4. Enable **USB debugging**.
5. When prompted, allow USB debugging access to your computer.  (Check "Always
   allow" to avoid repeated prompts.)

## Meshroom environment

The photoscan generation requires that the meshroom executable be in the system path in the environment in which Slicer is launched.
Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenwaterHealth/OpenLIFU-python?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-meshroom) to add download and add meshroom to the system path.
